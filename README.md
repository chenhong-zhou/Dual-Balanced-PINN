# Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN) 
Official code for the IJCAI 2025 paper "Dual-Balancing for Physics-Informed Neural Networks".



## Usage

Here we give the code to reproduce the results on six PDEs: Klein-Gordon Equation, Wave Equation, Helmholtz Equation, Allen-Cahn Equation, Burgers Equation, and Navier-Stokes Equation. 

Code was implemented in `python 3.7`. 

Just run the code in the .py script in the desired folder, for example:

```
python Klein-Gordon/Klein-Gordon.py
```

The training will begin, followed by the plots.
